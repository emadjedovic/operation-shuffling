# Operation Shuffling

**Operation Shuffling** is a technique used to obfuscate algorithms by randomly shuffling the sequence of operations, while maintaining the algorithm's correctness. This method can be employed to prevent reverse engineering and tampering in cybersecurity, intellectual property protection, and software development.

## Problem Statement

Given a series of operations in an algorithm, we aim to shuffle the operations such that the algorithm still functions the same way. Each operation has input and output variables. For example:

```plaintext
a, b = Operation1(c, d, e)
d, f = Operation2(b, h)
y, g = Operation3(u, v)
b = Operation4(d, r)
```

can result in:

```plaintext
y, g = Operation3(u, v)
a, b = Operation1(c, d, e)
d, f = Operation2(b, h)
b = Operation4(d, r)
```

or:

```plaintext
a, b = Operation1(c, d, e)
d, f = Operation2(b, h)
b = Operation4(d, r)
y, g = Operation3(u, v)
```

In the obfuscated version, operations are shuffled while preserving the dependencies between them, ensuring the algorithm works the same.

## Approach

This problem is modeled as a **dependency graph** problem:
- **Nodes**: Each operation is a node.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent dependenciesâ€”if operation `A` outputs a variable that operation `B` uses as input, an edge is created from `A` to `B`.

The solution begins by parsing the operations to identify the inputs and outputs for each operation, and then creating nodes based on this information. Next, a dependency graph is constructed where each operation's dependencies are represented as directed edges. After building the graph, a topological sort is performed to generate a valid execution order that respects the dependencies, with integrated shuffling for operations with zero dependencies.

# Usage

This C++ project allows you to input operations with dependencies and obfuscates the order of operations while maintaining the dependencies. It provides functionality to read inputs either from the console or from a file, and performs a topological sort with shuffling of operations that have no dependencies (zero in-degree).

### How to Run

1. **Console Input**: 
   - When running the program, choose option `1` to enter operations manually.
   - For example, input an operation in the following format:
     ```
     a,b = Operation1(x,y)
     c = Operation2(a,b)
     ```
   - Press `Enter` after each operation and leave an empty line to finish.

2. **File Input**: 
   - Choose option `2` to input operations from a file.
   - Ensure the file is placed in the `test-files/` directory, and the format inside the file should be:
     ```
     a,b = Operation1(x,y)
     c = Operation2(a,b)
     ```
   - For example, if your file is `test1.txt`, run the program and provide the filename when prompted.

The program will read the file, process the operations, shuffle them, and print the obfuscated output.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `OperationsGraph.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the graph data structure and operations logic.
- `main.cpp`: The entry point of the program, which handles input and runs the main logic.
- `test-files/`: A directory containing text files with operations for testing file-based input.

### `test-files/` Directory

The `test-files/` directory contains text files that store operation sequences. These files are used as input when the program is run with the file input option. The format for each operation in the file is:

```
output1,...,outputn = Operation(input1,...,inputm)
```

For example, a file might look like this:

```
a,b = +(x,y)
c = -(a,b)
```

To use file input:
1. Place your operation file in the `test-files/` directory (e.g., `test1.txt`).
2. When prompted by the program, enter the filename (e.g., `test1.txt`).
3. The program will process the file and display the obfuscated operations.

### Main Classes and Functions

- **Operation**: Represents a computational operation with inputs, outputs, and the original expression.
- **OperationsGraph**: A class that manages a graph of operations and handles topological sorting with shuffling of operations that have zero dependencies.

### Key Functions

- `addOperation`: Adds an operation to the graph and updates the dependencies.
- `topSortWithShuffle`: Performs a topological sort while shuffling operations that have no dependencies.
- `parseInput`: Parses a string input to create an `Operation` object.
- `processInput`: Processes input from either the console or a file to build the graph.
